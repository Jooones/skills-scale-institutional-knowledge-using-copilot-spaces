# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README is the central index for project management processes at OctoAcme.

## What are OctoAcme project management processes?

OctoAcme delivers customer value through a structured, iterative approach that emphasizes customer-first thinking, strong ownership, and clear roles. Our project management methodology is built on five key phases—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective—each with defined deliverables and decision gates. We maintain a customer-centric focus by prioritizing usability and measurable outcomes, while iterative delivery ensures we ship small, testable increments that reduce risk and accelerate feedback loops.

Core to our approach are well-defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk management; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features collaboratively; QA validates quality; and Stakeholders provide necessary inputs and approvals. This clarity of ownership ensures accountability and smooth collaboration across all project stages.

Our workflow practices emphasize quality and consistency. We use project boards to track progress from backlog to done, follow a pull request workflow with automated CI checks, and maintain small, reviewable code changes. Daily standups, weekly syncs, and regular demos keep the team aligned, while comprehensive testing—from unit tests to end-to-end smoke tests—ensures we meet our quality standards before release.

Communication and risk management are integral to our success. We maintain transparent stakeholder communication through weekly status updates and monthly briefings, all anchored to a single source of truth. Risks are proactively identified, assessed, and tracked in a Risk Register with clear ownership and mitigation plans. Our escalation paths ensure blockers are resolved quickly, and our blameless incident response culture turns challenges into learning opportunities through structured retrospectives and continuous improvement.
